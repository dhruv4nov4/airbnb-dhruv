Welcome to the "Clone of Airbnb Property Listing Page" project! This project replicates a simplified version of the Airbnb property listing page with essential features and a few enhancements.The home page allows users to explore a wide range of accommodation options, making it easy to find the perfect stay among hundreds of choices. The navigation bar includes a search function where users can input their desired destination, select dates, and specify the number of guests. This search leads them to a results page with relevant listings.

Users can sign in using their Google account for a more personalized experience.

On the search results page, users can further refine their search by sorting options from low to high prices or filtering for specific needs, such as couple-friendly or pet-friendly accommodations.

Clicking on a specific listing directs the user to a detailed place page, which provides extensive information about the property, including reviews, a calendar for date selection, and more. After choosing their preferred dates, users are taken to the checkout page.

The checkout process supports multiple payment methods, including PayPal, Google Pay, Visa, American Express, and Mastercard, ensuring a seamless and secure payment experience.

In your project directory, you can execute the following scripts:

### Development
- **`npm start`**  
  Launches the app in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The app will automatically reload if you make changes, and you may also see linting errors in the console.

### Testing
- **`npm test`**  
  Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### Production Build
- **`npm run build`**  
  Compiles the app for production into the `build` folder. It bundles React for production, optimizing the build for performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes. The app will be ready for deployment!

### Ejecting
- **`npm run eject`**  
  **Note:** This is irreversible. Once ejected, you cannot undo this action!  
  Ejecting copies all configuration files and dependencies like Webpack, Babel, and ESLint directly into your project. You'll have full control over them, but all commands except `eject` will still work, pointing to these copied scripts for modification. Use eject only if you need to customize beyond what the default setup allows.
