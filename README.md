Welcome to the "Clone of Airbnb Property Listing Page" project! This project replicates a simplified version of the Airbnb property listing page with essential features and a few enhancements.The home page allows users to explore a wide range of accommodation options, making it easy to find the perfect stay among hundreds of choices. The navigation bar includes a search function where users can input their desired destination, select dates, and specify the number of guests. This search leads them to a results page with relevant listings.

Users can sign in using their Google account for a more personalized experience.

On the search results page, users can further refine their search by sorting options from low to high prices or filtering for specific needs, such as couple-friendly or pet-friendly accommodations.

Clicking on a specific listing directs the user to a detailed place page, which provides extensive information about the property, including reviews, a calendar for date selection, and more. After choosing their preferred dates, users are taken to the checkout page.

The checkout process supports multiple payment methods, including PayPal, Google Pay, Visa, American Express, and Mastercard, ensuring a seamless and secure payment experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
